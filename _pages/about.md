Hey there! I'm Devesh Marwah, a proud survivor of a dual degree (B.Tech + MS by Research) in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad. My academic adventures have led me into the fascinating worlds of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, and Cognitive Science—basically teaching computers to read minds, one step at a time.

When I'm not busy debugging my life (or code), you'll probably catch me playing badminton, chess, or debating cricket stats. My downtime usually involves binge-watching crime thrillers and listening to bollywood music.


Currently, I am pursuing my dissertation under the guidance of Professor Aniket Alam, which explores the intersection of Political Science and Computer Science, specifically employing computational methodologies to analyze electoral politics in India.


Welcome to my corner of the internet—stay awhile, poke around, and feel free to say hi!
